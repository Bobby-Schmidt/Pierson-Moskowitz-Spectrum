# Pierson-Moskowitz-Spectrum
IPython Notebook describing the Pierson-Moskowitz Spectrum

### Purpose
This repository contains an IPython notebook that creates the shape and forces produced by waves according to the Pierson-Moskowitz Spectrum.
The equations used are discussed in [Guidance and Control of Ocean Vehicles](http://www.amazon.com/Guidance-Control-Ocean-Vehicles-Fossen/dp/0471941131/ref=sr_1_fkmr0_1?ie=UTF8&qid=1460664043&sr=8-1-fkmr0&keywords=guidance+navigation+and+control+of+ocean+vessels).

### Future Plans
Although it would require renaming of the repository, I would like to include code for multiple spectrums (i.e JONSWAP, Bretschneider, etc.).
